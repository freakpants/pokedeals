With a total of 330 cards, it's the largest expansion ever released in Japan. Even when considering international expansions, it holds this record.<\/p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Shiny Star V (Japanese: High Class Pack Shiny Star V) is a special expansion released during the Sword &amp; Shield series of the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game. In Japan, it represents the fourth subset released during the Sword &amp; Shield era. The expansion features Pok\u00e9mon V and VMAX, as well as Shiny Pok\u00e9mon.<\/p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">High Class Pack Shiny Star V was released in Japan on November 20, 2020, continuing the trend established by previous High Class Packs, with a significant number of reprinted cards, with a particular focus on Pok\u00e9mon V and Pok\u00e9mon VMAX. Some of the Pok\u00e9mon included in the subset feature artwork that was previously exclusive to English expansions and various products. The subset also includes a large number of shiny Pok\u00e9mon, all of which are reprints of cards released during the Sword &amp; Shield era, featuring a special embossed Holofoil treatment and being secret cards. All regular shiny Pok\u00e9mon cards have unique artwork and come in the \"S\" rarity, while all shiny Pok\u00e9mon V use their previous Full Art print artwork and come in the \"SSR\" rarity. With the exception of Amazing Rare Pok\u00e9mon, Pok\u00e9mon V, and Pok\u00e9mon VMAX cards, all non-secret cards have no rarity symbol.<\/p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Shiny Star V contains 330 cards, including 140 secret cards, making it the largest Japanese set, surpassing the 250 cards found in the GX Ultra Shiny subset. Shiny Star V also features a parallel foil set with a Reverse Halo Holofoil variant for all non-holofoil cards in the main set. Each booster pack contains 10 cards instead of the usual five, with a guaranteed Pok\u00e9mon V or Pok\u00e9mon VMAX card.<\/p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Cycle: Sword

containing only Secret Rares, often referred to as \"God-Packs.\" However, these are exceedingly rare.<\/p>\n<p>Tag All Stars (Japanese: TAG TEAM GX: High Class Pack: TAG TEAM GX: All Stars Markers) is the name of the nineteenth and final Japanese subset released during the Sun &amp; Moon era of Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game. It serves as an expansion to the twelfth and last main expansion Alter Genesis under the collection symbol \"SM12a.\" The set primarily consists of reprints of cards from the latter half of the Sun &amp; Moon era, with a focus on the popular Tag Team Pok\u00e9mon-GX cards.<\/p>\n<p>As the final main release of the Sun &amp; Moon era, the High Class Pack: TAG TEAM GX: Tag All Stars acts as a retrospective of the Tag Team expansion block, similar to The Best of XY for XY and XY BREAK eras. As such, it includes a large number of reprinted cards from that time, featuring key Tag Teams from the Tag Bolt, Double Blaze, and Miracle Twin expansions, as well as the Night Unison, Full Metal Wall, GG End, and Sky Legend subsets, among other popular Pok\u00e9mon-GX cards. Some Pok\u00e9mon featured in the subsets have artwork previously only available on cards outside of Japan.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to the previous High Class Pack GX Ultra Shiny, Tag All Stars includes a significant number of secret cards - a total of 53, including Full Art and Rainbow Rare versions of Pok\u00e9mon-GX that previously only received regular prints in standalone products, Full Art versions of previously released Trainer cards, and embossed Holofoil versions of basic Energy cards. The seven featured Tag Teams from previous expansions and subgroups also receive golden Ultra Rare versions for a total of 226 cards. Tag All Stars also features a foil set - every card without a rarity symbol includes a Mirror Holofoil variant. When combined with the standard set and 9 generic basic Energy cards, it forms a Master Set of 369 cards.<\/p>\n<p>Each booster pack contains 11 cards instead of the usual 5, including 1 guaranteed Pok\u00e9mon-GX card, 2 Holofoil cards, 1 Energy card, and 1 parallel foil card. Energy cards are always Mirror Holofoil, unless a pack includes a Super Rare version of one. Approximately 1 in 250 packs can contain 10 Super Rare cards in addition to the Energy card, colloquially known as \"God-Packs\" in other TCG circles, marking a first for the Pok\u00e9mon TCG in Japan.<\/p>\n<p>Cycle: Sun &amp; Moon<\/p>\n<p><em>Display Contents:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A display includes 10 boosters.<\/li>\n<li>Each booster contains 10 cards.<\/li>\n<li>Among them, one card is guaranteed to be a \"GX\" card or better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Box Type: Booster Box<\/em> <em>Brand: Pok\u00e9mon<\/em> <em>Language: Japanese<\/em> <em>Condition: New<\/em><\/p>\n<script src=\"moz-extension:\/\/00683565-a59f-4de6-a298-2bcb4f70ee35\/inpage.js\" id=\"hiro-wallet-provider\"><\/script>","published_at":"2023-09-26T03:01:19+02:00","created_at":"2023-09-26T03:01:19+02:00","updated_at":"2025-02-15T16:45:14+01:00","vendor":"SwissTcgShop","product_type":"","tags":[],"variants":[{"id":47115991777628,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":true,"price":"544.90","grams":205,"compare_at_price":null,"position":1,"product_id":8546116829532,"created_at":"2023-09-26T03:01:19+02:00","updated_at":"2025-02-15T16:45:14+01:00"}],"images":[{"id":50918076154204,"created_at":"2023-09-26T03:01:19+02:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2023-09-28T02:24:56+02:00","product_id":8546116829532,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0775\/6713\/1996\/files\/pok-mon-tag-team-gx-tag-all-stars-sm12a-booster-display-1.webp?v=1695860696","width":400,"height":400},{"id":50918075892060,"created_at":"2023-09-26T03:01:19+02:00","position":2,"updated_at":"2023-09-26T03:01:21+02:00","product_id":8546116829532,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0775\/6713\/1996\/files\/pok-mon-tag-team-gx-tag-all-stars-sm12a-booster-display-2.webp?v=1695690081","width":250,"height":469}],"options":[{"name":"Title","position":1,"values":["Default Title"]}]},{"id":8546113487196,"title":"Evolving Skies 3 pack Blister Umbreon Foil Promo Pokemon","handle":"evolving-skies-3-pack-blister-umbreon-foil-promo-pokemon","body_html":"<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words overflow-x-auto\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">\n<p>Unveil the magic of Pok\u00e9mon with the \"Evolving Skies 3 Pack Blister Umbreon Foil Promo\" set, a treasure trove of excitement and strategy awaiting your discovery.
