DUEL MONSTERS The Legend of Duelist QUARTER CENTURY Event held at the Tokyo Dome in Japan, returning the game to where it all began with a new strategy featuring the unstoppable Exodia!<\/span><br><br><span>By revealing all 5 pieces of Exodia from your hand or Deck, or having them on the field, you'll be able to Summon a brand-new \"Exodia\" Fusion Monster! It can't be destroyed by card effects and can add your current Life Points to its Attack Points every turn!<\/span><br><br><span>This boost never wears off, so if your opponent somehow manages to survive Exodia's onslaught, they'll just face a stronger Exodia the turn after that! Through its mastery of ancient powers, this new Fusion Exodia can cancel 1 Spell or Trap activation of your choice, every turn, for free, AND it fetches an Exodia-themed Spell\/Trap from your Deck each turn for YOU to use, also for free.<\/span><br><br><span>In Ancient Egypt, the Pharaoh and his priests fought with spiritual monsters, Summoning them forth from great stone tablets to strike down their foes! The Infinite Forbidden introduces a new theme that simulates this method of combat: First you place your \"tablet\" monster on the field as a Spell Card. Then, you infuse it with your life force (or Life Points in this case!) to Special Summon the card to the field as a monster! Each of these Summons is a Special Summon, so you can save your Normal Summon for something else!<\/span><br><br><span>If giving up your Life Points to fuel these monsters isn't your style, there's a special new Spell Card to give you a bit of Millennium Magic of your own - just reveal it from your hand and you don't have to pay any Life Points to Summon forth the monsters from their stones! And since revealing it doesn't get rid of it, you can do so over and over again. This Spell is also crucial because it's used to Summon the \"Exodia\" Fusion Monster!<\/span><br><br><span>The Infinite Forbidden contains 100 new cards in all, for a variety of strategies, new and old, including a brand-new World Premiere theme! It also continues the fun of the 25th anniversary celebration by including 25 Quarter Century Secret Rares, including 1 special card.<\/span><br><br><span>The Infinite Forbidden core booster set looks like this:<\/span><br><span>10 Secret Rares<\/span><br><span>14 Ultra Rares<\/span><br><span>26 Super Rares<\/span><br><span>50 Commons<\/span>","published_at":"2024-03-28T17:55:39+01:00","created_at":"2024-03-28T17:52:56+01:00","updated_at":"2024-11-29T11:19:48+01:00","vendor":"Konami","product_type":"Booster Box","tags":["sale","ygo"],"variants":[{"id":47826104549706,"title":"English","option1":"English","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"ForbiddenEN","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":false,"price":"59.90","grams":0,"compare_at_price":"64.90","position":2,"product_id":8738359476554,"created_at":"2024-03-28T17:52:56+01:00","updated_at":"2024-11-29T11:19:48+01:00"},{"id":47826104582474,"title":"German","option1":"German","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"ForbiddenDE","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":null,"available":false,"price":"59.90","grams":0,"compare_at_price":"64.90","position":3,"product_id":8738359476554,"created_at":"2024-03-28T17:52:56+01:00","updated_at":"2024-11-29T11:19:48+01:00"}],"images":[{"id":55017158771018,"created_at":"2024-03-28T17:53:10+01:00","position":1,"updated_at":"2024-03-28T17:53:13+01:00","product_id":8738359476554,"variant_ids":[],"src":"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0792\/9924\/8458\/files\/x_kona18558.png?v=1711644793","width":800,"height":837}],"options":[{"name":"Language","position":1,"values":["English","German"]}]},{"id":8738357248330,"title":"Yu-Gi-Oh! - Battles of Legend: Terminal Revenge - Booster Box","handle":"yu-gi-oh-battles-of-legend-terminal-revenge-booster-box","body_html":"<span>This display contains 24 Yu-Gi-Oh! booster packs with 5 cards each.<\/span><br><br><span>Battles of Legend: Terminal Revenge combines the storytelling of the Hidden Arsenal series with its own signature blend of foil-ups for popular cards, and gives Duelists another shot at tournament-level cards.

These themes formed the backbone of the Hidden Arsenal booster sets for years and appeared in many core booster sets as well! In Battles of Legend: Terminal Revenge, you'll find new cards for:<\/span><br><br><span>Ice Barrier!<\/span><br><span>Freeze out your opponent with a new Level 10 Synchro Monster that Summons an \"Ice Barrier\" monster from your Deck, Extra Deck, hand, or Graveyard when your opponent Special Summons! There's a wide variety of domineering \"Ice Barrier\" monsters, so there's bound to be at least one that freezes your opponent's strategy in its tracks. You can also find a new version of Brionac, the first of the dragons trapped in the Ice Barrier!<\/span><br><br><span>Genex!<\/span><br><span>Genex Controller, the little Normal Monster that could, is getting more than a new coat of paint! Use it to Link Summon a brand-new Link-1 monster that can generate theoretically limitless Normal Summons! As long as you can keep adding \"Genex\" monsters to your hand with card effects, you can keep Normal Summoning them out right away - perfect for assembling powerful Synchro Monsters like Locomotion R-Genex, or the new Level 10 \"Genex\" Synchro in this set that can repeatedly negate and destroy your opponent's monsters by banishing monsters from your Graveyard!<\/span><br><br><span>Infernoid!<\/span><br><span>The world-shaping flood of Infernoids began in Secrets of Eternity and continues here! Fusion Summon a new Level 1 \"Infernoid\" Fusion Monster that swiftly multiplies the number of \"Infernoid\" monsters you have in your Graveyard, then finish off your opponent with a devastating Link-4 \"Infernoid\" Link Monster! Even better, since Link Monsters have no Level or Rank, it won't count against the '8 or lower' total Levels\/Ranks restriction to Special Summon most \"Infernoid\" effect monsters!<\/span><br><br><span>Ritual Beast!<\/span><br><span>The bonds between spiritual beasts and their tamers are reforged! You can only Special Summon each Main Deck \"Ritual Beast\" monster once per turn, so you need as many Tamers and Spiritual Beasts in your Deck as possible. Fans of this strategy can find a new version of Lara, one of the original Ritual Beast Tamers, as well as 2 new Ulti- class Ritual Beasts for your Extra Deck, including a Link Monster!<\/span><br><br><span>Even More New Cards<\/span><br><span>On top of that, you'll find new cards that bolster strategies introduced in Phantom Nightmare and Legacy of Destruction.
